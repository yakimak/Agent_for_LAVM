Here is a few examples showing you how to answer the question step by step.

Question 1: In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is "Pa" is the nominative form, "Mato" is the accusative form, and "Sing" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is "Maktay". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is "Tay", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is "Aktay". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as "is pleasing to", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is "Apple" is the nominative form, "Zapple" is the accusative form, and "Izapple" is the genitive form. 

Please translate "I like apples" to Tizin.
Steps:
1. Determine the order of words from the prompt (Verb - Object - Subject).
2. Determine the present form of Like ("Maktay")
3. Determined that since the person doing the liking is the object of the sentence, the next word must be the one for oneself in object form.
4. Determined the accusative form for onesself ("mato").
5. Determined the nominative form for apple. ("apple").
6. Put the words together in the correct order.
Tools:
None
Final Answer: Maktay mato apple

Question 2: Which of the fruits shown in the 2008 painting "Embroidery from Uzbekistan" were served as part of the October 1949 breakfast menu for the ocean liner that was later used as a floating prop for the film "The Last Voyage"? Give the items as a comma-separated list, ordering them in clockwise order based on their arrangement in the painting starting from the 12 o'clock position. Use the plural form of each fruit.
Steps:
1. Use search engine to search for "2008 painting Embroidery from Uzbekistan".
2. Open the top result, a link to the painting's page on the Dayton Art Institute website, and verify that the painting has the specified title and year.
3. Identify the fruits in the painting as watermelon, pear, lemon, and banana, which can be verified by either watching the video on the page or reading its linked transcript.
4. Use search engine to search for "ocean liner floating prop The Last Voyage".
5. Note from the results that this ocean liner was the SS  le de France.
6. Use search engine to search for "October 1949 breakfast menu SS  le de France".
7. Go to the result that shows the vintage SS  le de France breakfast menu for October 1949.
8. Search the menu for each of the four fruits from the painting, finding "Pear" and "Bananas" but no matches for "lemon" or "watermelon".
9. Check the positions of the fruits in the painting to find that the pears come before the bananas in clockwise order starting from the 12 o'clock position.
10. Format the final answer as specified using the correct ordering: pears, bananas
Tools:
1. Web browser
2. Search engine
3. Image recognition and processing tools
Final Answer: pears, bananas

Question 3: Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show "Pick That Ping-Pong". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.
Steps:
Step 1: Evaluate the problem statement provided in my user's prompt
Step 2: Consider the probability of any ball on the platform earning the prize.
Step 3: Evaluate the ball in position one. The probability of it earning the prize, P1, is 1/3
Step 4: Using a calculator, evaluate the ball in position two. The probability of it earning the prize, P2, is the difference between 1 and the product of the complementary probabilities for each trial
P2 = 1 - (2/3)(2/3)
P2 = 5/9
Step 5: Using a calculator, evaluate the ball in position three. The probability of it earning the prize, P3, is the difference between 1 and the product of the complementary probabilities for each trial
P3 = 1 - (2/3)(2/3)(2/3)
P3 = 19/27
Step 6: Consider the possible outcomes of numbers higher than 3.
Step 7: For each trial, either 1 or 2 balls from the ramp will advance to the platform. For any given selection, there is a 50% chance that the ball advances to position 2 or position 3.
Step 8: As position three holds the highest chance of earning the prize, select the only ball known to occupy position three with certainty, ball 3.
Step 9: Report the correct answer to my user, "3"

None
Final Answer: 3
